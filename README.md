## Technical Task for Interview: Integrate SWAPI GraphQL API with a SwiftUI iOS App

### Objective:
The goal of this technical task is to evaluate your expertise in developing iOS applications using SwiftUI and integrating them with GraphQL APIs. 
You will create a simple SwiftUI iOS application that interacts with the Star Wars API (SWAPI) available at [API here](https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index.)

### Task Description:
  Your task is to develop a SwiftUI application that accomplishes the following:

  • Fetch List of Star Wars Films:
  • Create a SwiftUI view that lists all Star Wars films by title.
  • Display Film Details:
  • Upon tapping a film from the list, navigate to a detail screen that displays the film's title, episode number, opening crawl text, and list of characters.
  • Search Functionality:
  • Implement a search bar that allows users to search for films by title.

### Requirements:
  • The app must be developed using SwiftUI.
  • Use Apollo GraphQL client for API integration.
  • Your code should be version-controlled using Git.


### Deliverables:
  • A functioning iOS application that meets all of the above criteria.
  • Source code for the application, submitted via a Git repository.
  • A README file that includes:
  • Instructions for running the application.
  • Any design decisions you made and the reasoning behind them.



### Evaluation Criteria:
  • Code quality, organization, and readability.
  • Proper implementation of SwiftUI components.
  • Correct and efficient integration with the GraphQL API.
  • Handling of potential API errors and edge cases.
  • Quality and clarity of the README and any inline documentation.
